# Braincharter Vasculature Notebook v1.0
Interactive vascular segmentation for 3D images. 


- The notebook will install the necessary python files; comment the "!pip install" if you do not want this.
- Jump to the section "Parameters to set" to set the necessary parameters. All lines that can/should be edited are identified in comments in the two cell blocks of this section
- Images are plotted automatically at each step. You can then adjust some parameters and rerun the process until satisfied!

Versions:

*V1.0*: A lot of upcoming features were not included, as the paper related to those is not published yet. This covers the 'basic' functions for vascular segmentation
